Things to do while mirgating from Django 1.0 to 1.3:
1. in urls.py:
Your url for admin should be:
url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls))
not (r'^admin/(.*)', admin.site.root) 
- it's for Django 1.0. For Django 1.3 it wouldn't work.

2. From projects/forms remove error_message parameter from class ProjectForm
