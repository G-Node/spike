<here goes segment>

http://neo/data/segment_14/

<data only>

http://neo/children/segment_14/

<here goes list of children>

and 

http://neo/parents/segment_14/

<here goes list of parents>




But what would be also nice:


http://neo/segment_14/analogsignal_367/signal/

<here goes signal>

or 

http://neo/list/block/

<lists all blocks>
Maybe do this additionally? Just for listing all objects somewhere
