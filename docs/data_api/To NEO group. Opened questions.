stupid in diagram

- IrSaAnalogSignal, AnalogSignal: channel_name - why do we need this attribute if we have a link to recording channel?
- why t_start is optional in IrSaAnalogSignal?
- why IrSaAnalogSignal has 2 1D arrays, instead of 1 2D array?
- why do waveforms have a property "channel index" instead of a link to recordingchannel?
- why don't we want to have Spiketrains containing spikes (with waveforms) and not 3D waveform array?
